### **BYLINE / DATELINE**

`By [Reporter Name] – [Date]`
(Optional: “on Capitol Hill” or “for Punchbowl News”)

---

### **OPENING PARAGRAPH (The Lede)**

**Purpose:** Capture the action *and* its Hill significance.
Politico-style ledes are one to two sentences, brisk, with “moment + meaning.”

**Template:**

> The House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday advanced **H.R. 4273**, a bipartisan measure to renew FDA’s over-the-counter drug user-fee program — a vote that highlights rare cooperation on health policy ahead of a packed end-of-year agenda.

---

### **PARAGRAPH 2: Immediate Context / Stakes**

Adds one layer of **why this matters right now** — tie to timing, leadership goals, or broader negotiations.

**Template:**

> The move comes as lawmakers race to clear a backlog of authorization bills before funding deadlines hit in December. Committee leaders said the measure would give the FDA stability after pandemic-era disruptions, though some members warned it doesn’t go far enough on transparency.

---

### **PARAGRAPH 3–4: Inside the Room (Markup / Hearing Dynamics)**

Describe the **markup drama, amendments, quotes, and vote**.
This section often opens with a transition like “During the markup…” or “Behind closed doors, members…”

**Template:**

> During Wednesday’s markup, lawmakers adopted a manager’s amendment negotiated by Chair **Cathy McMorris Rodgers** and Ranking Member **Frank Pallone**.
>
> The panel also debated a series of Democratic proposals to expand reporting rules and pediatric testing — most of which failed on party-line votes. The final tally: **31–23**, with four Democrats joining Republicans.

---

### **PARAGRAPH 5: The Politics (Insider Takeaway)**

This is where *Politico* and *Punchbowl* earn their reputation — explain the *power dynamics* or *strategic positioning.*

**Template:**

> The markup underscored a delicate balance for GOP leaders trying to show legislative progress while internal divisions linger over spending levels. For Democrats, supporting the measure offered a low-risk way to demonstrate bipartisanship ahead of a possible year-end health-care package.

---

### **PARAGRAPH 6: What’s Next (Procedural Outlook)**

Tell readers what happens *next* procedurally — floor votes, Senate companion, White House stance.

**Template:**

> The bill now heads to the full House, where leadership hopes to pair it with other FDA programs later this month. A Senate companion from **Bill Cassidy (R-La.)** is expected in the coming weeks, setting up negotiations before the current user-fee authority expires in 2026.

---

### **CLOSING GRAF: Broader or Emotional Takeaway**

End with a forward-looking or reflective note — sometimes quoting a principal or hinting at bigger stakes.

**Template:**

> “This is about keeping lifesaving products on shelves,” Rodgers said after the vote. Still, with Congress facing another funding showdown, even modest bipartisan bills like this one could become collateral in the broader budget fight.

---

### **OPTIONAL ELEMENTS**

* **Inline “sub-heds” (used sparingly):**
  *Inside the markup • What’s next • The politics* — used as bold lead-ins, not section titles.
* **Bullet callouts** for amendments or votes (often in *Pro* newsletters).
* **Boxed “The Numbers” sidebar** for votes, sponsors, or notable amendments (not in body text).
