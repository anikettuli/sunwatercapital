### Senate Appropriations Committee Moves "Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2026" Forward

By Sarah Miller - October 26, 2025

The [Senate Appropriations Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/ssap00) has advanced the "Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2026" (S. 2257), marking a key step in the chamber's broader budget negotiations as it enters the [Senate Legislative Calendar](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/2257). The bill, reported by the committee on July 10, 2025, remains stalled with no recorded votes and no proposed amendments.

The timing of this action is particularly sensitive given ongoing discussions regarding overall spending levels for the next fiscal year. Leadership's push to finalize appropriations bills before Thanksgiving adds urgency to the process. The lack of a vote underscores the challenges facing any potential bipartisan agreement on funding for the legislative branch itself. 

During the markup, [Sen. Mullin, Markwayne](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/M001190) (R-OK) was identified as a sponsor of the bill. However, despite the Appropriations Committee reporting the measure, he is not associated with the committee itself. The absence of hearings and votes indicates a significant hurdle to progress - no data exists on whether this legislation is moving along party lines. 

"We're focused on ensuring that Congress has the resources it needs to do its job," stated [Sen. Mullin, Markwayne](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/M001190) in a recent statement, though no further comments were available regarding this specific bill. 

Next, the bill will remain on the Senate Legislative Calendar pending consideration by the full Senate. Without a vote, its future remains uncertain and dependent on broader budget negotiations.
