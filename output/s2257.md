## Senate Ticks Off "Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2026" - Mullin's Role Remains Unclear

By Alex Johnson - October 26, 2025

The Senate quietly advanced the "Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2026" (S. 2257) this week, marking a key step in the annual budget process--but with significant questions surrounding its path forward and the involvement of key lawmakers. The bill's current status within the Appropriations Committee highlights ongoing maneuvering as Congress prepares for the fall funding deadlines.

**Immediate Context**

As of today, [S. 2257](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/2257) remains in the Appropriations Committee, where it was reported on July 10, 2025, and placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar under General Orders (Calendar No. 113). Despite being sponsored by [Sen. Mullin, Markwayne](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/M001190) (R-OK), he is not currently listed as a member of the Appropriations Committee itself - raising questions about his direct influence on the bill's final form. The lack of recorded votes and hearings suggests a deliberate strategy by leadership to keep the legislation under wraps for now.

**Inside the Room**

The bill's placement on the Legislative Calendar indicates it is moving towards potential floor action, though no votes have yet been scheduled. Crucially, there are currently no proposed amendments - a notable absence that could signal a desire for a clean-handed passage or perhaps an attempt to avoid potential roadblocks. The fact that no hearings have been recorded further underscores the deliberate pace of its advancement, likely orchestrated by committee leadership seeking to manage competing priorities and gauge support before revealing the bill's full scope.  The [Appropriations Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/ssap00) is working to finalize the details, with strategic positioning key for members like Sen. Mullin.

**Politics**

Sen. Mullin's sponsorship of S. 2257 does not automatically translate to a prominent role in shaping the legislation's content.  The lack of committee membership and hearings suggests that his influence may be limited at this stage. While the bill represents an opportunity for him to demonstrate support for the Legislative Branch, its current status highlights the challenges of securing significant leverage within a complex appropriations process - particularly when not seated on the relevant committee. The absence of bipartisan activity surrounding the bill also hints at potential divisions within the Republican caucus.

**What's Next**

The next key step will be determining whether the Appropriations Committee will hold hearings to delve deeper into the bill's provisions and address any concerns raised by stakeholders.  Given the lack of prior activity, a hearing is not guaranteed, suggesting that leadership may prefer to maintain control over the narrative surrounding the legislation. The Senate's Legislative Calendar indicates the bill is awaiting further action, leaving its future uncertain until the committee decides on next steps.

**Closing Graf**

As Congress navigates a packed legislative agenda, the slow-moving progress of S. 2257 underscores the intricate power dynamics at play within the Appropriations Committee and highlights [Sen. Mullin, Markwayne](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/M001190)'s position as a key player in the budget process--even without formal committee assignment.
