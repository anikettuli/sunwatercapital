# Senate Appropriations Bill Remains Dormant as Mullin Champions Funding Request

By Sarah Miller - August 1, 2025

**Inside the Room** - The "Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2026" ([S2257](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/2257)), championed by Senator Markwayne Mullin (R-OK), remains stuck in the Senate [Appropriations Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/ssap00) with no indication of forthcoming hearings or votes, according to data released today. The bill, focused on funding for Congress itself, is currently languishing on the Legislative Calendar under General Orders - a quiet signal of potential challenges ahead.

**Context** - Congressional appropriations bills are typically high-stakes political battles, often reflecting broader partisan divisions. While this particular measure deals with the operations of the legislative branch, its passage could still be used as leverage in larger budget negotiations. The bill's current state underscores the delicate balance between procedural maneuvering and legislative priorities within a deeply divided Congress.

**Politics** - Senator Mullin's sponsorship and committee membership - he sits on the [Appropriations Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/ssap00) - position him at the center of this nascent effort.  However, the absence of cosponsors and any reported amendments suggest a potentially narrow path forward for the bill. The lack of hearings further complicates matters, hindering opportunities for broader debate or input from outside stakeholders. 

**What's Next** - As of today's data, the most recent action recorded for [S2257](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/2257) was simply "Placed on Senate Legislative Calendar under General Orders. Calendar No. 113." This indicates a procedural step completed by the Senate but offers no insight into whether it will move toward a vote or face further delays.  The bill's future hinges entirely on the [Appropriations Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/ssap00)'s deliberations, a process that remains opaque at this time.

**Closing Graf** - With no amendments proposed and limited activity surrounding the bill, [S2257](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/2257) represents a quiet, yet potentially significant, indicator of the challenges facing Congress in securing funding for its own operations - a challenge amplified by the current political climate.
