# Hospital Bill Inches Closer to House Vote After Committee Markup

By Sarah Miller - Washington, D.C. - November 8, 2025

**Immediate Context:** The "Hospital Inpatient Services Modernization Act" ([HR4313](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/4313)), spearheaded by Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-FL-16), moved a step closer to potential floor action today as it remained placed on the House Union Calendar.  The bill, focused on health policy, has undergone committee review but remains without amendments and pending further votes.

**Inside the Room:** The bill's journey through the House system is currently centered within the [Ways and Means Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hswm00).  On September 17, 2025, the committee marked up [HR4313](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/4313), a procedural vote that placed it on the Union Calendar (Calendar No. 311) on October 31, 2025. Rep. Buchanan, serving on the [Ways and Means Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hswm00), is one of eight cosponsors.  Notably, there have been no amendments proposed at this stage.

**Politics:** The bill's placement on the Union Calendar signals a degree of support within the House, though specifics regarding the vote's partisan makeup remain unclear based on available data.  While Rep. Buchanan's involvement suggests potential backing from his Florida district - and perhaps broader Republican circles - the absence of reported votes or amendments adds an element of uncertainty to its prospects. 

**What's Next:**  The bill now awaits further action on the House floor. The precise timing of any vote remains unknown, contingent upon scheduling decisions within the House leadership.  Its path through the legislative process will depend entirely on future committee considerations and ultimately, a full House vote.  The current status - Calendar No. 311 - represents a crucial milestone in its consideration.

**Closing Graf:** With no amendments yet introduced and a lack of recorded votes, [HR4313](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/4313)'s momentum hinges now on the broader dynamics within the House, where Republican and Democratic leadership will ultimately determine whether it reaches the floor for a potentially pivotal vote.
