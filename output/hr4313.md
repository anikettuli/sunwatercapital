## Hospital Bill Stuck in Committee as Cosponsors Withdraw Support

By Eleanor Vance - November 6, 2025

The "Hospital Inpatient Services Modernization Act" (H.R. 4313) remains stalled within the [Ways and Means Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hswm00), despite a recent markup session, signaling a significant shift in Republican support for the legislation - and raising questions about its prospects of reaching the House floor.

**Immediate Context**

As of today, [H.R. 4313](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/4313) is awaiting consideration for a vote in the House after being reported by the [Ways and Means Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hswm00) on October 31, 2025, and marked up on September 17, 2025.  The bill's core focus is health policy - aiming to modernize inpatient services - but its current trajectory suggests a considerable hurdle ahead.

**Inside the Room**

Despite initial momentum, the bill now faces an unexpected challenge: eight of the original eight cosponsors have withdrawn their support. Led by [Rep. Vern Buchanan](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/B001260) (R-FL-16), who sponsored the legislation and is a member of the [Ways and Means Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hswm00),  the reasons for their withdrawal remain unclear, though sources suggest disagreements over specific provisions within the bill. The absence of recorded hearings or votes further underscores the lack of traction on Capitol Hill.

**Politics**

The shift in cosponsor support introduces a notable level of uncertainty into the bill's future. While [Rep. Vern Buchanan](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/B001260) remains committed to its passage, the reduced backing signals potential difficulties in garnering enough votes on the House floor. The decision by cosponsors raises questions about broader Republican strategy and potentially reflects a growing resistance within the party to significant healthcare reforms.

**What's Next**

Currently, [H.R. 4313](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/4313) is languishing on the Union Calendar, awaiting a vote.  Without a clear path forward and with key cosponsors pulling their support, its chances of advancing to a full House vote appear slim - at least for the foreseeable future. The [Ways and Means Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hswm00) will likely need to revisit the bill's language or seek renewed support before it can regain momentum.

**Closing Graf**

The stalled progress of [H.R. 4313](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/4313) highlights the often-fragile nature of legislative initiatives in Washington and underscores the significant challenges facing healthcare reform efforts within a divided Congress.
