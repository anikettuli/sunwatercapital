### Commerce Committee Advances Manufacturing Strategy Bill - But No Votes Yet

By Jake Miller - November 2, 2025

The [Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/sscm00) has moved forward with "Streamlining American Manufacturing Strategy Act" (S. 2318), marking a key step in the Senate's efforts to bolster domestic industrial capacity - though no votes have yet been recorded on the measure. The bill, referred to the committee in July and reported out in October, is now positioned for consideration on the [Senate Legislative Calendar](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/2318).

Immediate context surrounds this legislation as part of a broader push by leadership to address supply chain vulnerabilities highlighted during recent economic challenges. The bill's passage through committee signals an intent to prioritize domestic manufacturing, though the lack of votes raises questions about its potential for swift floor action. 

During the markup, [Sen. Blunt Rochester, Lisa (D-DE)](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/B001303), a cosponsor of S. 2318 and member of the Commerce Committee, indicated that no amendments were proposed on the bill. The committee's focus remains squarely on the core provisions designed to streamline manufacturing processes.  As of today, November 1st, there have been no recorded votes related to this legislation.

The politics surrounding S. 2318 are largely procedural at this stage, with [Sen. Blunt Rochester](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/B001303)'s support representing a key element of the bill's momentum within the committee.  Its placement on the Senate Legislative Calendar - under General Orders - suggests an intention to move it through regular order, though the pace remains uncertain. 

What's next involves continued consideration on the [Senate Legislative Calendar](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/2318).  The bill's path forward will depend on scheduling and broader legislative priorities within the Senate, with no current indication of when a floor vote might occur.
