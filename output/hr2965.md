## Small Business Bill Inches Closer to Floor Vote Amid GOP Push

By Alex Johnson - October 9, 2025

The "Small Business Regulatory Reduction Act of 2025" ( [H.R.2965](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/2965) ) is moving through the House, fueled by Republican efforts to ease burdens on small businesses - a move that's already sparking debate about potential bipartisan support and the bill's ultimate fate.

**Immediate Context:**

As of today, [H.R.2965](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/2965) remains within the purview of the [Small Business Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hssm00), where it was reported and marked up on May 21, 2025.  The bill's placement on the Union Calendar - specifically Calendar No. 82 - signals a significant step toward potential floor consideration. However, crucial details regarding the nature of any votes cast remain unclear, leaving the path forward uncertain.

**Inside the Room:**

The legislation itself aims to reduce regulatory burdens on small businesses, a priority for many Republicans heading into the midterm elections.  [Rep. Beth Van Duyne](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/V000134) (R-TX-24), a cosponsor of [H.R.2965](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/2965), sits on the [Small Business Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hssm00) where it originated, suggesting a key role in shaping its trajectory.  Currently, the bill has five cosponsors, demonstrating some initial Republican buy-in. Notably, there are no amendments listed for this legislation, indicating a currently streamlined approach within the committee.

**Politics:**

The lack of reported votes and amendment activity raises questions about the level of bipartisan support surrounding [H.R.2965](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/2965). While Republicans are driving the initiative, securing sufficient support from Democrats to pass the bill on the House floor will be a considerable challenge. The absence of publicly available data regarding party-line votes adds to the opacity surrounding its potential success.

**What's Next:**

The placement on the Union Calendar is a procedural hurdle cleared; the next step involves scheduling it for a vote.  However, with no record of recent votes and no amendments in play, the bill's path to the floor remains fluid.  Leadership will likely need to weigh strategic considerations - including potential opportunities for amendment insertion - before formally scheduling a vote.

**Closing Graf:**

As [H.R.2965](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/2965) continues its journey through the House, it will be closely watched for signs of bipartisan collaboration - or a renewed push from Republican leadership to advance the bill despite potential roadblocks.
