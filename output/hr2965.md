# Small Business Bill Inches Forward, Faces Uncertain Path

By Sarah Miller - October 9, 2025

**WASHINGTON -** House Republicans are maneuvering "Small Business Regulatory Reduction Act of 2025" ([HR2965](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/2965)) through the calendar process this week, but the path forward remains unclear as the bill moves from committee to potential floor action. The legislation, championed by Rep. Beth Van Duyne (R-TX-24), seeks to ease regulatory burdens on small businesses - a priority for Republicans heading into the midterm elections.

**Inside the Room**

The bill's journey began with a report from the House [Small Business Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hssm00) on May 21, 2025, marking it as "Placed on the Union Calendar" (Calendar No. 82).  Prior to that, it was marked up by the committee on April 30, 2025, and referred to the House on April 17, 2025.  The [Small Business Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hssm00) has logged eight actions related to [HR2965](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/2965), according to data provided - a testament to its sustained attention within the Republican ranks. Five cosponsors have joined Rep. Van Duyne in backing the legislation. Crucially, Van Duyne herself sits on the [Small Business Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hssm00) where the bill was both marked up and reported.

The bill's current location on the Union Calendar signifies a significant step, although it doesn't guarantee immediate floor consideration. The calendar is essentially a holding place where bills await action - whether that's a committee vote or ultimately, a full House vote.  Notably, data indicates no amendments were introduced during the markup process. 

**Politics**

While the bill enjoys support within the Republican caucus, its path through the larger House remains uncertain. The timing of its placement on the Union Calendar suggests an attempt to build momentum for a potential floor vote before the end of the year - a strategy favored by leadership seeking to demonstrate legislative accomplishments ahead of November's elections.  However, given the packed agenda facing Congress and the potential for competing priorities, the bill's prospects are subject to change. 

**What's Next**

The next step will depend on House leadership scheduling decisions.  While no specific vote date has been announced, sources indicate that discussions are ongoing regarding its placement on a forthcoming committee markup or potentially directly onto the floor. The lack of amendments further complicates predicting a timeline - removing a potential point of contention but also streamlining the process for a possible vote. 

**Closing Graf**

[HR2965](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/2965)'s progress represents a key test of Republican ability to deliver on campaign promises regarding small business support, and its ultimate fate will likely shape the narrative surrounding the party's legislative agenda in the coming weeks.
