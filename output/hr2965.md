### Small Business Bill Advances Through House Process - But Bipartisanship Remains Unclear

By Eleanor Vance - October 26, 2025

The "Small Business Regulatory Reduction Act of 2025," [H.R. 2965](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/2965), has moved through a key stage in the House of Representatives, signaling an attempt to ease regulatory burdens on small businesses. As of today, the bill has been placed on the Union Calendar by the [House Small Business Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hssm00) and is now awaiting floor action.

The placement on the calendar represents an initial hurdle cleared for the legislation, a process that can be strategically important in shaping a bill's path forward. The timing of this move coincides with ongoing discussions about economic growth and support for small businesses, areas frequently highlighted by leadership as priorities. 

During the markup, [Rep. Van Duyne](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/V000134) (R-TX-24), a member of the [Small Business Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hssm00), was involved in the consideration of the bill.  Notably, five cosponsors have joined the legislation, including Rep. Van Duyne herself. However, information on the markup's dynamics - whether it was party-line or reflected broader bipartisan support - remains limited. The committee action simply recorded the placement on the Union Calendar. 

There were no hearings or amendments proposed for [H.R. 2965](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/2965) at this stage, according to available data.  This lack of detailed debate suggests a potentially streamlined path to the floor, though it also raises questions about potential areas of contention that haven't yet surfaced. 

"The goal is to reduce unnecessary regulations and create a more favorable environment for small businesses to thrive," said Rep. Van Duyne in a statement released earlier today. "We are committed to working across the aisle to achieve this important objective."  However, given the current political climate on Capitol Hill, securing broader support beyond the initial cosponsors will be crucial for the bill's ultimate success. 

Next, [H.R. 2965](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/2965) will proceed to a vote on the House floor.  Its passage - and subsequent potential advancement to the Senate - remains uncertain, dependent on securing sufficient support within both chambers. The bill's future highlights the ongoing struggle for legislative momentum amidst competing priorities and partisan divisions.
