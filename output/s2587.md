## Appropriations Bill Stalls in Senate Calendar Amid Quiet Activity

By Sarah Miller - July 31, 2025

**WASHINGTON --** [S2587](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/2587), the "Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2026," remains lodged on the Senate Legislative Calendar under General Orders, signaling a cautious approach to the critical funding package as it awaits further action - though no hearings or amendments have yet been proposed.

**Immediate Context:** The bill, championed by Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), was reported out of the Senate Appropriators Committee on July 31st.  Its placement on the calendar represents a procedural step, not an endorsement, and highlights the delicate maneuvering occurring within the chamber as lawmakers navigate a packed legislative agenda.

**Inside the Room:** The bill's current status reflects a lack of immediate urgency regarding the appropriations process. According to data obtained from Senate records, no hearings have been scheduled on [S2587](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/2587).  Furthermore, there are currently no proposed amendments attached to the legislation. This suggests a potential strategy among some senators - perhaps those sponsoring it - to avoid early debate and shape the bill's final form through subsequent negotiations.

**Politics:** Senator Capito's sponsorship of the appropriations bill places her squarely in the center of this process, though she is not listed as a member of the [Appropriations Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/ssap00) that reported the legislation. This suggests a potential need for coordinated efforts between the committee and other senators to move the bill forward. The absence of amendments, at least so far, points to a desire for consensus-building - or perhaps a deliberate strategy to avoid contentious debates before the full Senate considers the measure.

**What's Next:**  The next significant step for [S2587](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/2587) will depend on whether the Senate Majority Leader decides to bring it up for consideration. Until then, it remains passively positioned on the Legislative Calendar - a holding pattern in a chamber grappling with competing priorities and political pressures. The lack of hearings or amendments suggests a deliberate pause, waiting for a clearer signal about the bill's prospects. 

**Closing Graf:**  The slow-moving progress of [S2587](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/2587) underscores the challenges facing appropriations legislation in a deeply divided Congress - a situation where even seemingly routine funding bills can become focal points for partisan strategy and negotiation.
