## Appropriations Bill Remains Quiet on Capitol Hill

By Eleanor Vance - October 26, 2025

The "Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2026" [S. 2587](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/2587) is currently stalled in the Senate Appropriations Committee, with no votes recorded and no amendments proposed - a sign of potential challenges ahead as it navigates the complex landscape of budget negotiations.

**Immediate Context**

As of today, [S. 2587](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/2587) is under consideration by the Senate Appropriations Committee [Appropriations Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/ssap00). The bill, championed by Senator Shelley Capito [Sen. Capito](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/C001047) (R-WV), represents a significant funding package for critical federal agencies - but its current lack of movement raises questions about the path forward.

**Inside the Room**

The bill, reported by the Senate Appropriators Committee on July 31, 2025, and placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar under General Orders, remains largely untouched. There have been no recorded hearings related to [S. 2587](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/2587), suggesting a cautious approach within the committee. Senator Capito is listed as a sponsor of the legislation, indicating her commitment to its passage - but without any amendments filed or votes cast, progress has been slow.

**Politics**

The absence of activity surrounding [S. 2587](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/2587) points to a broader challenge facing the Appropriations process: securing consensus across the partisan divide. The current environment on Capitol Hill is characterized by deep divisions, and funding bills are often subject to intense negotiation and strategic maneuvering. The lack of movement could signal that the bill faces significant hurdles in reaching final passage.

**What's Next**

With no amendments proposed and no votes recorded, the future of [S. 2587](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/2587) remains uncertain. The bill is expected to continue its journey through the Senate Appropriations Committee, where further debate and potential amendments could shape its final form. However, given the current political climate, a swift resolution appears unlikely.

**Closing Graf**

The quiet treatment of [S. 2587](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/2587) reflects the broader challenges facing Congress as it seeks to finalize appropriations for fiscal year 2026 - a process that could prove protracted and fraught with political tension.
