### Appropriations Bill Remains Stalled in Senate Committee

By Eleanor Vance - October 26, 2025

The "Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2026" [S. 2587](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/2587) remains stuck in the Senate Appropriations Committee, with no hearings or proposed amendments filed as of today. The bill, sponsored by [Sen. Capito](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/C001047), Shelley Moore [R-WV], has been placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar under General Orders.

The lack of movement comes amid ongoing negotiations surrounding broader appropriations deadlines and a delicate balancing act between Republicans and Democrats as the end of the fiscal year approaches. The bill's current status underscores the challenges facing the [Appropriations Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/ssap00) in securing consensus on key funding priorities across multiple agencies.

During the markup, no hearings were recorded for this bill and no amendments have been proposed. This indicates a significant lack of engagement surrounding its content at this time. 

The current situation reflects a strategic pause from [Sen. Capito](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/C001047) as she navigates the complex landscape of appropriations negotiations.  It's unclear whether further discussion or revisions will be pursued, though the bill remains under the jurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee.

Next steps remain uncertain; the bill is now awaiting further action from the Senate.
