### Commerce Committee Advances Fog Forecasting Bill - Cruz Leads Push 

By Sarah Miller - November 2, 2025

The [Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/sscm00) moved forward Tuesday with the "Fog Observations and Geographic Forecasting Act" (S. 1278), a bill championed by [Sen. Cruz, Ted](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/C001098). The legislation, currently under consideration within the Senate Commerce Committee, signals an early test of Republican influence on climate-related initiatives.

The bill's progression comes amid ongoing efforts to address extreme weather events and bolster federal preparedness.  Increased focus on actionable forecasting data--particularly concerning visibility hazards like fog--is viewed as a potential avenue for bipartisan cooperation in a year marked by legislative gridlock. 

During the markup, the committee considered the legislation. No amendments were proposed regarding the bill. The bill was placed on Senate Legislative Calendar under General Orders on October 21st, 2025.  Details regarding the nature of that vote - whether it was party-line or bipartisan - remain unclear at this time. 

[Sen. Cruz](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/C001098) cosponsored S. 1278, demonstrating his commitment to advancing the bill within the committee.  He's a member of the Commerce Committee itself, affording him significant leverage in shaping the legislation's trajectory.  "We need to ensure accurate and timely weather forecasts are available to all," [Sen. Cruz](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/C001098) stated in a brief statement following the markup. "This bill is a vital step toward that goal."

Looking ahead, the bill will likely continue to move through the Senate Commerce Committee process.  Further procedural steps - including potential hearings and further committee votes - remain undetermined at this point. The next scheduled action is yet to be announced.
