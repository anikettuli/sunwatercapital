## Fog Act Inches Forward, Committee Report Signals Potential Senate Push

By Sarah Miller - Washington - October 25, 2025

**Inside the Room:** The "Fog Observations and Geographic Forecasting Act" ([S1278](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/1278)) is moving through the Senate [Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/sscm00), though a lack of hearings and amendments suggests a potentially cautious path ahead.

**Immediate Context:** Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), a key member of the committee, has cosponsored the bill, which was referred to the Senate on April 3rd, 2025, and subsequently marked up by the committee on April 30th, 2025. The legislation's report date - October 21st, 2025 - indicates a significant step forward, placing it on the Senate Legislative Calendar under General Orders.

**Politics:** While Senator Cruz's sponsorship signals support within the Republican ranks, the absence of hearings and proposed amendments raises questions about broader bipartisan backing. The bill's placement on the legislative calendar suggests a deliberate effort to build momentum for a potential vote, but without further action, its prospects remain unclear.  Crucially, there has been no evidence of any hearings related to [S1278](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/1278), indicating a possible strategy by committee leadership to avoid contentious debate at this stage.

**What's Next:** The bill's placement on the Senate Legislative Calendar means it is now awaiting consideration for potential action - whether through unanimous consent or a more formal vote.  The October 21st report date signifies that the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee has completed its review of the legislation, but further procedural hurdles remain before it can advance to full Senate debate. The lack of amendments suggests a desire for a streamlined process, potentially prioritizing efficiency over broader stakeholder input.

**Closing Graf:**  [S1278](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/1278)'s journey through the Senate remains uncertain, with the absence of hearings and amendments highlighting the delicate balance between committee leadership's strategic maneuvering and the need to build consensus in an increasingly divided Congress.
