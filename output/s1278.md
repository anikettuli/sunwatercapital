## Fog Act Stalls in Senate Commerce Committee Amid Quiet Debate

By Alex Johnson - November 2, 2025

The "Fog Observations and Geographic Forecasting Act" (S. 1278), a bill aimed at bolstering meteorological forecasting related to fog, is currently languishing within the [Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/sscm00) as it awaits further action on the Senate Legislative Calendar. The bill's lack of hearings and proposed amendments signals a potentially slow path to potential passage - or outright defeat - in the current environment.

**Immediate Context:**

As of today, [S. 1278](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/1278) remains referred to the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee and sits on Calendar No. 197.  It was reported by the committee on October 21st, 2025, and placed on the Legislative Calendar under General Orders on October 21st, 2025. While a procedural vote occurred on that date - marking its placement on the calendar - details regarding whether it was party-line or bipartisan remain unclear according to available data.  The bill's focus on improved fog forecasting highlights increasing concerns about weather-related disruptions and safety issues across various sectors.

**Inside the Room:**

Senator [Ted Cruz](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/C001098) (R-TX) is currently a cosponsor of the bill, indicating some level of support within the Republican ranks. However, the absence of hearings and amendments suggests that the bill hasn't garnered widespread momentum or triggered significant debate within the committee.  The lack of activity raises questions about the level of interest from other senators and potential roadblocks to its advancement. No amendments have been proposed on the legislation thus far.

**Politics:**

The timing of this bill's consideration is noteworthy, occurring amidst broader debates regarding government spending and legislative priorities. The [Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/sscm00) has a packed agenda, and competing demands for resources and attention could impact the fog act's prospects.  The committee's current focus on other legislation likely means limited bandwidth to fully scrutinize this comparatively narrow proposal.

**What's Next:**

With no scheduled hearings or amendments, the bill's future hinges on whether it will be brought up for a vote by the full Senate at some point. The placement on the Legislative Calendar simply indicates that it is awaiting consideration; there's no guarantee of when - or if - it will move forward.  Further developments will depend heavily on shifts in committee priorities and external pressures.

**Closing Graf:**

The "Fog Observations and Geographic Forecasting Act" represents a quiet, yet potentially significant, piece of legislation navigating the complexities of the Senate calendar. Its current state underscores the challenges facing even relatively uncontroversial bills seeking traction within a divided Congress.
