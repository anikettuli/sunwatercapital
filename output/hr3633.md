### Committee Referrals Digital Asset Clarity Act Amid Growing Scrutiny

By Eleanor Reynolds - September 24, 2025

The [Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025](HR3633) is moving through the congressional process, with its latest referral to the Senate's [Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/ssbk00) marking a significant step - and raising questions about potential bipartisan support. The bill, sponsored by [Rep. Hill, J. French](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/H001072) (R-AR-2), aims to provide clarity regarding digital assets, currently referred to the [Financial Services Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsba00) and the [Agriculture Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsag00) in the House.

The bill's referral to the Senate Banking Committee follows a September 18th decision to refer it to that chamber, where it was subsequently referred to the committee. Data indicates no specific vote details regarding party affiliation at the time of referral - merely noting its placement within the committee structure.  Twenty-one members cosponsored [H.R. 3633](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/3633), including [Rep. Hill, J. French](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/H001072) who sits on the Banking Committee. 

During a markup session, the committee considered proposed amendments, with Amendment HAMDT 48 - adopted by agreement to the Rules amendment (A001) - receiving approval. This amendment, originating from the Committees on [Agriculture](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsag00) and [Financial Services](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsba00), was modified by House Report 119-199.  This underscores the potential for significant changes to the legislation as it moves forward.

"We are committed to ensuring a clear regulatory framework for digital assets," stated [Rep. Hill, J. French](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/H001072) in a recent statement. "This bill is a crucial step toward fostering innovation and protecting consumers."

Looking ahead, the bill will likely continue its consideration within the Senate Banking Committee.  While no hearings have been recorded as of today, September 24th, 2025, the passage of Amendment HAMDT 48 suggests potential for further debate and adjustments prior to a possible floor vote. The path forward remains uncertain, with the bill's ultimate fate hinging on committee consensus and broader legislative priorities within Congress.
