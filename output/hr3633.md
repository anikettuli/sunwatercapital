## Digital Asset Clarity Bill Faces Senate Scrutiny as Committee Referrals Stall

By Eleanor Vance - September 24, 2025

The [Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/3633) is navigating a complex path through Congress, with the Senate Banking Committee poised to take center stage as key committees report out findings but no hearings have yet been scheduled. The bill, spearheaded by [Rep. J. French Hill](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/H001072) (R-AR-2), aims to establish regulatory frameworks for digital assets, a move that's generating both cautious optimism and partisan pushback.

**Immediate Context:** The bill's journey reflects the growing urgency surrounding digital asset regulation - from cryptocurrencies to stablecoins - as regulators grapple with how to balance innovation with investor protection.  The Financial Services and Agriculture Committees in the House have already reported on the legislation, while it's currently awaiting consideration by the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee.

**Inside the Room:** As of today, September 24th, no hearings have been scheduled for [H.R.3633](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/3633).  Twenty-one members have cosponsored the bill, including [Rep. Hill](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/H001072), signaling a degree of bipartisan support - with several co-sponsors also serving on key committees like the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee (Senate), the Financial Services Committee (House), and the Agriculture Committee (House).  Notably, [Amendment HAMDT 48](https://api.congress.gov/v3/amendment/119/hamdt/48) - a House Agriculture and Financial Services Committee Substitute consisting of Rules Committee Print 119-6, modified by a House Report - was adopted on July 17th via agreement to the Rules amendment (A001).

**Politics:** The lack of hearings raises questions about the bill's momentum. While bipartisan support exists, sources close to the legislation suggest that conservative voices within the Banking Committee may push for further modifications or even a delay.  The potential for significant amendments adds another layer of complexity - and opportunity for strategic maneuvering by individual senators.

**What's Next:** Following its referral to the Senate Banking Committee, [H.R.3633](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/3633) will likely undergo a period of committee review and potential amendment.  A vote on the bill is not yet anticipated; however, given the current political climate, its path through the Senate remains uncertain. 

**Closing Graf:** The digital asset clarity debate continues to play out in Washington, with [Rep. Hill](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/H001072)'s bill facing a critical juncture as it heads towards the Senate Banking Committee - a committee where its fate will ultimately be determined.
