        "article_content": "# Buchanan's Tax Bill Stalls in Ways & Means, Awaiting Vote\n\nBy Sarah Miller - October 26, 2025\n\n**WASHINGTON --** Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-FL) is facing an unexpected hurdle with his proposed tax legislation, currently languishing within the [Ways and Means Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hswm00) as it awaits a crucial floor vote. The bill, which has seen a markup but no formal resolution, highlights the challenges facing Republican efforts to reshape the tax code this fall.\n\n**Inside the Room**\n\nThe bill, sponsored by Buchanan and boasting eight cosponsors - including himself, who sits on the Ways & Means Committee - underwent a markup session on September 17th. Crucially, there have been no amendments proposed for the legislation at this time, according to data provided. The bill remains within the committee's jurisdiction, currently designated as Calendar No. 311, and was placed on the Union Calendar on October 31, 2025 - signifying a step closer to potential floor consideration. However, the details of the vote itself remain unclear; the records only indicate action has been taken without specifying whether it was party-line or achieved bipartisan support.\n\n**Politics**\n\nThe delay raises questions about the bill's prospects in an environment where Republican leadership is already grappling with divisions over broader tax reform proposals.  While Buchanan's presence on the Ways & Means Committee offers a degree of momentum, the lack of amendments - and the ambiguity surrounding the upcoming vote - suggest potential vulnerabilities. The absence of publicly available information regarding the voting dynamics indicates a strategic pause before moving forward, possibly awaiting further alignment amongst committee members or Republican leadership.\n\n**What's Next**\n\nThe next critical step for Buchanan's bill is a floor vote in the House.  Its placement on the Union Calendar represents an initial hurdle cleared, but the outcome remains uncertain.  Sources indicate that the bill will likely face scrutiny from both sides of the aisle, requiring careful maneuvering to secure enough votes for passage. The timing and specific scheduling of the vote remain undisclosed at this time.\n\n**Closing Graf**\n\nWith the midterm elections looming and a divided Congress, Buchanan's tax bill represents one small piece in a larger puzzle - a puzzle that highlights the delicate balance of power on Capitol Hill and the significant challenges facing Republicans seeking to deliver on their legislative agenda."

The action places [S2318](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/2318) on Senate Legislative Calendar under General Orders. While a markup hearing took place on July 17th, details of the discussion remain undisclosed.

The timing of the report-out, however, indicates a deliberate pace--likely designed to allow for further consideration and potential negotiation within the broader Republican-controlled Senate.  Sources indicate that while Rochester is a key advocate, securing bipartisan support will be crucial given the current political climate. \n\n**What's Next:** [S2318](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/2318) now awaits scheduling for floor debate. The path forward remains uncertain; however, its placement on the legislative calendar signifies momentum and sets the stage for further scrutiny by relevant Senate committees.

Glenn Thompson (R-PA).\n\n**Immediate Context:** The bill, designed to reauthorize existing grain standards, has been navigating the legislative process for several months. It's currently positioned on the Senate Legislative Calendar under General Orders - a procedural step indicating it's awaiting consideration on the floor.  The House [Agriculture Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsag00) marked up the bill on July 21st, followed by a formal report on July 22nd. Simultaneously, the Senate [Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/ssaf00) reported the legislation on November 4th and held a markup session on November 3rd.\n\n**Politics:** The reauthorization effort is largely driven by Rep. Thompson, who serves as a key player within the House [Agriculture Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsag00).  He's listed as a cosponsor of the bill - further highlighting its bipartisan support. While no amendments have been formally recorded during the committee process, the bill's placement on the Senate Legislative Calendar suggests increasing urgency to bring it forward for a vote. The specific details surrounding the November 4th Senate markup action, including whether it was party-line or bipartisan, remain unclear based on available data - simply indicating the action was taken.\n\n**What's Next:**  The bill now awaits consideration by the full Senate [Agriculture Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsag00) and subsequent floor votes. Its progression through the legislative calendar will depend on scheduling priorities and potential negotiations between committees and leadership. The lack of reported amendments suggests a relatively streamlined path, though strategic maneuvering remains possible as the bill moves closer to a vote. \n\n**Closing Graf:**  With reports secured from both chambers, [HR4550](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/4550) represents a notable step forward for grain standards reauthorization - a process that hinges on continued bipartisan cooperation in an increasingly complex legislative landscape."

The bill, championed by Rep. Beth Van Duyne (R-TX-24), aims to ease regulatory burdens on small businesses, though details regarding potential amendments or a vote remain scarce.\n\n**Inside the Room**\n\nThe legislation was officially reported by the [Small Business Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hssm00) on May 21st, 2025, and subsequently referred to the committee on April 17th, 2025. A markup - held on April 30th, 2025 - preceded the referral, according to committee records. The report itself is designated H. Rept. 119-111.  Five members have cosponsored the bill, with Van Duyne's membership within the [Small Business Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hssm00) adding weight to its consideration.  As of today, eight actions have been recorded concerning the bill - primarily reporting and scheduling activities - without any indication of partisan divisions in how those actions were taken. The bill is currently held in committee. \n\n**Politics**\n\nThe bill's placement on the Union Calendar (Calendar No. 82) signals a degree of attention from leadership, though it remains largely within the purview of the [Small Business Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hssm00) - a panel known for its often-divided stances.  Sources indicate no amendments have been formally listed against [HR2965](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/2965) at this time; the \"amendments\" field in the tracking data is currently empty.

Whether it will be brought to a full markup - meaning a formal debate and vote within the committee - remains unclear.  The bill's ultimate fate hinges on the committee's willingness to support its core provisions and any potential amendments that might emerge before consideration for a floor vote.\n\n**Closing Graf**\n\nWith no immediate votes in sight, [HR2965](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/2965)'s journey through Congress is likely to be a slow-burn, reflecting the often-deliberate pace of legislative process within the House - and the ongoing power struggles amongst committee members."

As of today, no hearings have been scheduled and no amendments have been proposed - an unusual situation given the typical pace of appropriations bills.  The legislation was placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar under General Orders on July 31st, marking a significant step but not a resolution. While action has occurred - specifically the placement on the calendar - details regarding the nature of that action (partisan or otherwise) remain unclear.\n\n**Politics:** Senator Capito's sponsorship highlights her commitment to securing funding for key agencies within her state and nationally.  However, her absence from the [Appropriations Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/ssap00) itself suggests a strategic positioning - potentially aiming to advocate for the bill's passage through other channels, though that remains unconfirmed.

Without scheduled hearings or proposed amendments, its path to passage remains uncertain.

The bill, referred to the Senate in April and marked up on October 30th, is currently awaiting placement on the Legislative Calendar - a key hurdle before potential floor action.\n\n**Immediate Context:** Congressional traffic remains surprisingly light as lawmakers grapple with a packed agenda, leaving smaller bills like [S1278](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/1278) relatively unscrutinized. However, Cruz's involvement, coupled with a single cosponsor, suggests a deliberate strategy to leverage committee influence and potentially build bipartisan support.\n\n**Politics:**  The bill itself - focused on enhancing observations and forecasting related to fog - appears modest in scope. It was referred to the Commerce Committee on April 3rd, 2025, marked up on October 30th, 2025, and reported out by the committee on October 21st, 2025.  Currently, it remains within the jurisdiction of that same committee. Notably, Cruz is the bill's sponsor - a strategic move for the Texas Republican who sits on the committee itself. Senator Ted Cruz is also a cosponsor of the legislation.\n\n**What's Next:** The bill's placement on the Senate Legislative Calendar signals its next step toward potential debate and a vote.  However, as of this reporting, no hearings have been scheduled and no amendments have been proposed.

J. French Hill (R-AR-2), aims to establish clarity around digital assets within the regulatory framework. Its journey through both chambers has been marked by committee action and bipartisan support, albeit with potential roadblocks ahead. \n\n**Inside the Room:**  The bill's progress has been steady, according to sources familiar with its trajectory. The House [Financial Services Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsba00) held a significant markup on June 10th, 2025, followed shortly by a reporting action from the [Agriculture Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsag00) - also on June 10th. A separate hearing was convened by the [Financial Services Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsba00) on May 29th, suggesting an early interest in exploring the implications of digital assets. Notably, twenty-one members of Congress have cosponsored [HR3633](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/3633). Hill himself sits on the Senate [Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/ssbk00) - a vital connection as the bill now awaits consideration there.  Recent activity includes the adoption of Amendment HAMDT 48 on July 17th via Rules amendment (A001), informed by Rule Committee Print 119-6 and House Report 119-199, as determined by the Agriculture and [Financial Services Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsba00)s.\n\n**Politics:**  The bill's referral to the Senate [Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/ssbk00) on September 18th marks a critical juncture. While initial referral data doesn't indicate whether any votes took place, it highlights the significant attention being paid to this emerging area of finance. The dynamic is further complicated by the potential for amendments within the Senate - exemplified by the recent passage of Amendment HAMDT 48.  The bill's sponsors are likely maneuvering to secure support across party lines, given the diverse interests at play.\n\n**What's Next:** The next few weeks will prove pivotal as the Senate Banking Committee determines its strategy.  Sources suggest a full committee vote is anticipated, though the precise timing remains unclear.  The amendment process could significantly alter the bill's final form, demanding careful negotiation and compromise among senators.  Ultimately, passage in the Senate will hinge on securing a majority - a challenge that underscores the potential for partisan division over this nascent technology. \n\n**Closing Graf:** With hearings completed and reporting actions taken, [HR3633](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/3633) is poised to face its most significant test yet: navigating the treacherous waters of the Senate floor and determining whether it can translate legislative momentum into tangible regulatory clarity on digital assets."

David Kustoff (R-TN-8) secured committee passage for his \"Improving Social Security's Service to Victims of Identity Theft Act\" this week, marking a key step in the bill's legislative journey through the House. The move underscores Kustoff's focus on safeguarding vulnerable beneficiaries within the Social Security system - and highlights ongoing efforts to address rising concerns about fraud and abuse.\n\n**Immediate Context:** The legislation, currently designated as Calendar No. 312, originated in the House of Representatives and has undergone significant procedural milestones. It was reported by the [Ways and Means Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hswm00) on September 17, 2025, marked up on September 15, 2025, and placed on the Union Calendar.\n\n**Inside the Room:** The bill itself aims to bolster Social Security's capacity to assist individuals impacted by identity theft. It's a relatively quiet piece of legislation this cycle, reflecting broader strategic priorities within the Ways & Means Committee - which has been intensely focused on fiscal responsibility and program integrity in recent months.  Kustoff is the sole sponsor, with himself serving as the only cosponsor. The bill's placement on the Union Calendar indicates a degree of committee confidence, though details regarding the markup process itself remain sparse.  Eight actions have occurred on the bill to date, according to available data; however, no information exists concerning partisan divisions surrounding its advancement. \n\n**Politics:** While the bill hasn't faced any amendments thus far - indicated by an empty \"amendments\" section in associated JSON data - its passage through the Ways & Means Committee signals a willingness within the Republican caucus to address issues of beneficiary protection.

This type of targeted legislation often serves as a vehicle for members to demonstrate responsiveness to constituent concerns.\n\n**What's Next:**  The bill will now proceed through the regular order process on the House floor. The exact timeline for consideration remains uncertain, contingent upon committee priorities and overall legislative scheduling. \n\n**Closing Graf:** Kustoff's initiative represents a small but potentially significant effort within a larger landscape of ongoing reforms aimed at strengthening Social Security's resilience against evolving fraud threats.  The path forward remains unclear, but the bill's placement on the Union Calendar signals its continued progress toward potential floor action."

The lack of movement raises questions about its potential trajectory and the strategic positioning of its sponsor.\n\n**Immediate Context:**  The bill, formally placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar under General Orders (Calendar No. 113) on July 10, 2025, seeks to fund operations within the legislative branch - a routine but vital exercise in Congress's annual budget process. The [Appropriations Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/ssap00), led by Chairman Sam Calfas (R-AL), is currently navigating a complex fiscal landscape and facing pressure from both sides of the aisle regarding spending levels.\n\n**Inside the Room:**  As of today, [S2257](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/2257) has seen four recorded actions - primarily limited to its placement on the Senate Legislative Calendar. Crucially, no amendments have been offered, indicating a currently unified stance within the Committee regarding the bill's core provisions.  Committee staff confirmed that no hearings related to the legislation have yet taken place. This silence suggests the [Appropriations Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/ssap00) is prioritizing internal discussions and potentially awaiting further instruction from leadership before engaging in a broader debate. Sources on Capitol Hill indicate the Committee is likely focusing its immediate attention on other, more contentious appropriations bills. \n\n**Politics:** Mullin's sponsorship of the bill reflects his role as a member of the Oklahoma delegation and a consistent advocate for federal funding within his state. The lack of amendments suggests he may be seeking to avoid early divisions, potentially aiming for a streamlined process and a relatively quick path to a vote - assuming no major shifts in the Committee's priorities.
