As of October 9, 2025, the bill has become Public Law No. 119-21, marking its official passage through both the House and Senate.\n\nThe legislation encompasses a wide range of policy changes, including significant tax cuts for individuals and corporations, measures aimed at reducing the national debt through spending caps and rescissions, and provisions impacting energy production and environmental regulations.  Changes to social programs like SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) are also included within the package. \n\nRep. Jodey Arrington (R-TX-19) is credited as the bill\u2019s sponsor, with it currently referred to the House [Budget Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsbu00). Throughout its journey through Congress, the bill faced numerous amendments. Notably, Amendment SA 2848, aimed at improving the overall legislation, was agreed upon in the Senate, while Amendments SA 2849 and 2847 failed to gain approval by a narrow margin.  Numerous smaller \u201cSmaller Amendatory Technical Changes\u201d (SAMDTs) were also proposed.\n\nThe bill\u2019s passage wasn't without significant budgetary scrutiny. The House [Budget Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsbu00) held hearings and produced committee reports, including \"H. Rept. 119-106, Book 1\" and \"H. Rept. 119-106, Book 2,\" which detailed the estimated impact on the deficit.  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) repeatedly analyzed the bill\u2019s budgetary effects, concluding that it would increase the deficit relative to various baseline budgets.\n\nVotes were held on several amendments in the Senate on July 1, 2025; Amendment SA 2848 passed with a 51-50 vote (bipartisan), while Amendments SA 2849 and 2847 failed by votes of 45-55 and 50-50 respectively. The original bill itself was passed by the House on May 22, 2025.  Further details regarding the specific amendments and CBO analyses can be found in the referenced committee reports."

This amendment was approved via voice vote on October 9th.  However, Amendment SA 3927, aimed at limiting the use of Federal law enforcement officers for crowd control, failed to pass with a Yea-Nay vote of 47-50 on the same date.\n\nFurthermore, Amendment SA 3926, focused on national security and sanctions against specific individuals within the People\u2019s Republic of China, was also adopted by voice vote.  Senator Wicker has proposed numerous additional amendments \u2013 SA 3925 through 3915 \u2013 which cover a range of national security and defense policy matters.\n\nThe bill's passage represents a significant step in shaping the nation\u2019s defense strategy for the upcoming fiscal year. Further action will likely be taken as the legislation moves through the House of Representatives."
