        "article_content": "# Hospital Bill Stalls in House, Awaiting Calendar Placement\n\nBy Alex Johnson - November 5, 2025\n\n**WASHINGTON --** The \"Hospital Inpatient Services Modernization Act\" ([HR4313](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/4313)), championed by Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-FL-16), is currently stuck awaiting consideration on the House floor after being placed on the Union Calendar by the [Ways and Means Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hswm00).  The bill, focused squarely on health policy, has undergone a markup but faces an uncertain path forward.\n\n**Inside the Room**\n\nThe legislation, formally reported by the [Ways and Means Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hswm00) on September 17, 2025, and subsequently marked up on October 31, 2025, is now awaiting its turn for a full House vote.  Eight cosponsors have officially backed the bill, though eight others have withdrawn their support. Rep. Buchanan himself serves on the [Ways and Means Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hswm00) that shaped the legislation.  Notably, no amendments have been proposed to date - according to available data, the \"amendments\" section of the JSON record is empty. On October 31, 2025, the bill was placed on the Union Calendar (Calendar No. 311), signaling its readiness for floor debate, though information regarding the nature of any votes held at that time remains unavailable.\n\n**Politics**\n\nThe placement on the Union Calendar represents a key step for Buchanan - and potentially a strategic maneuver by committee leadership.  However, it also underscores the challenges facing many bills in the current House environment. The lack of amendments suggests a degree of consensus within the [Ways and Means Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hswm00), but the withdrawal of eight cosponsors raises questions about broader support. Sources indicate that while a markup occurred on September 17th, the exact details of the discussion are not publicly available.\n\n**What's Next**\n\nThe bill's progression now rests entirely in the hands of House leadership.  Its placement on the Union Calendar doesn't guarantee immediate action; it simply signals that it is eligible for consideration during floor debate.  Analysts anticipate a closely watched vote, given the limited public information and the current climate within the House. The timing and order of votes remain to be seen.\n\n**Closing Graf**\n\nThe \"Hospital Inpatient Services Modernization Act\"'s journey through Congress highlights the often-opaque process of legislative movement on Capitol Hill - and the delicate balance between committee consensus and broader political considerations."

Senator Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE) is a key cosponsor and member of the committee overseeing its consideration.  A \"Markup By\" hearing occurred on July 30th, indicating the committee's initial review process. Crucially, no amendments have been proposed to date - the bill remains largely unchanged as it moves forward.\n\n**Politics:** The procedural placement on the Senate Legislative Calendar doesn't reveal whether the action was driven by partisan lines or a bipartisan consensus. Data currently available simply indicates calendaring for consideration; there's no indication of the vote's composition. Senator Rochester's involvement suggests potential support within the Democratic caucus, although the lack of amendment activity raises questions about broader engagement with the bill's content.\n\n**What's Next:** The \"Streamlining American Manufacturing Strategy Act\" now sits on the Senate Legislative Calendar, awaiting further action - most immediately, a vote.  The path to final passage remains uncertain and will likely hinge on securing sufficient support within the Senate to overcome any potential roadblocks.  The committee's reporting out on October 29th represents an important milestone, but ultimately, the bill's fate rests with the full Senate.\n\n**Closing Graf:** With no amendments filed and a procedural calendar placement in hand, [S2318](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/2318) now enters a critical holding pattern as lawmakers consider its implications for U.S. manufacturing policy - a process that will likely unfold over the coming weeks."

The reauthorization effort, spearheaded by Rep. Glenn Thompson (R-PA), marks a critical step for the agricultural sector as it seeks to update existing regulations governing grain quality and trade.\n\n**Inside the Room**\n\nThompson's bill has been meticulously reviewed in recent weeks. The House [Agriculture Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsag00) held a Markup By action on July 21, 2025, followed by a Reported By action on July 22, 2025. Simultaneously, the Senate [Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/ssaf00) reported the bill on November 4, 2025, and conducted a markup session on November 3, 2025.  Notably, the bill is currently awaiting consideration by the Senate - it's been placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar under General Orders. While specific voting details remain unavailable--the data only indicates calendar placement on November 4th--it suggests momentum toward potential action.\n\n**Politics**\n\nThe bipartisan nature of the legislation remains unclear.  While Rep. Thompson is the sole listed cosponsor, currently identified as serving on both the House and Senate Agriculture committees, the lack of publicly available information regarding votes or amendments points to a potentially party-line debate ahead.  Currently, there are no listed amendments for [HR4550](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/4550).\n\n**What's Next**\n\nThe bill's path through the Senate remains uncertain.  Its placement on the Legislative Calendar signals it is moving forward, but the absence of voting data and amendment discussions suggests a potentially protracted process. Congressional sources indicate that floor debate could occur in the coming weeks - assuming no significant roadblocks emerge from either committee.  Stakeholders within the grain industry are closely watching developments as the reauthorization effort progresses.\n\n**Closing Graf**\n\nWith key committees having completed their respective actions, [HR4550](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/4550) appears poised for a critical vote in the Senate, potentially shaping the future of U.S. grain standards and trade policy."

As of today, it's officially \"Placed on the Union Calendar, Calendar No. 82\" following a report and markup by the [Small Business Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hssm00) on May 21st.\n\n**Inside the Room:** The bill's momentum was driven largely by Representative Beth Van Duyne (R-TX-24), who cosponsored the legislation and served on the committee where it was marked up.  Five total members backed the measure, including Van Duyne. A markup session occurred on April 30th, and a referral to the [Small Business Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hssm00) took place on April 17th, culminating in the report's release last month. Crucially, there are no amendments currently listed for the bill - the \"amendments\" array within the available data is empty.  Eight distinct actions have been recorded for [HR2965](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/2965) to date, most recently its placement on the Union Calendar.\n\n**Politics:** The timing of the calendar placement is significant. While the bill's path forward isn't immediately clear, it highlights the ongoing efforts by Republicans to prioritize small business concerns heading into an upcoming election cycle.  However, determining whether the eventual floor vote will be partisan remains impossible based solely on this procedural record - further data regarding the calendar's deliberations would be required to assess the potential for bipartisan support. \n\n**What's Next:** The bill now awaits placement on the House Rules Committee agenda, a critical step that could influence its chances of reaching a full floor vote before year-end.  The Rules Committee has significant power to shape legislative timelines and can effectively kill bills deemed too controversial or lacking broad support. Analysts will be closely watching for any signals regarding the committee's intentions - a signal that would indicate whether this small business relief effort has a realistic shot at becoming law. \n\n**Closing Graf:** With no amendments filed and its placement on the Union Calendar, [HR2965](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/2965) represents a fragile foothold in the House calendar, a testament to Republican efforts but also a stark reminder of the political hurdles that remain before small businesses see regulatory relief."

As of this morning, no hearings have been scheduled and no amendments have been proposed for the legislation. This lack of movement raises questions about the committee's priorities and potential roadblocks to securing funding for key agencies.\n\n**Politics:** Senator Capito's sponsorship signals a deliberate strategic move - she is listed as a sponsor despite not being directly involved in shaping the bill within the [Appropriations Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/ssap00).  This suggests an effort to align her policy preferences with the legislation, potentially building support from outside the committee's core group. However, the absence of committee involvement highlights a significant power dynamic: the bill's direction is currently controlled by a majority of the panel, leaving Capito's influence somewhat constrained. \n\nThe last recorded action on [S2587](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/2587) was simply \"Placed on Senate Legislative Calendar under General Orders\" on July 31st - a procedural step that doesn't indicate bipartisan support or opposition. The lack of further activity suggests either deliberate caution within the committee, or perhaps an internal disagreement regarding key funding levels.\n\n**What's Next:**  The bill's path forward remains uncertain. Without scheduled hearings and proposed amendments, it is unlikely to gain significant traction in the near term.  Sources on Capitol Hill suggest that the [Appropriations Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/ssap00) will likely continue to deliberate internally over the coming weeks, though no firm timeline for a vote has been established. The absence of any discernible momentum raises concerns about potential delays impacting funding for Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education programs heading into the new fiscal year. \n\n**Closing Graf:**  [S2587](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/2587)'s stalled position underscores the challenges facing appropriations bills in a closely divided Congress - a landscape where even prominent sponsors must navigate complex committee dynamics to secure their priorities."

As of Wednesday, the bill remained on the Senate Legislative Calendar following a report from the [Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/sscm00) last month - a significant step forward, yet one fraught with potential hurdles.\n\n**Inside the Room:** The legislation, championed by Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), was referred to the committee on April 3rd, 2025, and subsequently marked up on April 30th.  The Commerce Committee officially reported it out on October 21st, 2025, placing it under General Orders for consideration. Crucially, no hearings have been held on the bill - a fact that sources within the committee suggest has raised concerns among some Democrats. Senator Cruz's presence as a cosponsor and member of the reporting committee provides him with leverage, but doesn't guarantee its passage.\n\n**Politics:** The bill's movement underscores the ongoing challenges faced by legislation seeking bipartisan support in today's Capitol Hill climate. While one cosponsor - Cruz - has signaled his backing, there is no evidence of amendments being proposed or votes taken on the full text of the bill. This lack of engagement suggests a potential strategy to avoid a decisive vote and further delay action.  Sources indicate some committee members are wary of taking a stand without robust debate and amendment opportunities.\n\n**What's Next:** The placement on the Senate Legislative Calendar signifies that it is awaiting consideration by the full Senate. However, with no recorded votes and a lack of amendments, its path forward remains uncertain. The bill's future hinges on whether leadership will prioritize its advancement and whether enough senators are willing to support its passage - a prospect looking increasingly distant given current divisions.  The next step will depend entirely on the Senate Majority Leader's strategy and willingness to bring the bill up for consideration. \n\n**Closing Graf:** As [S1278](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/1278) continues its methodical journey through the Senate, it serves as a stark reminder of the painstaking process required to navigate the legislative landscape - and the significant obstacles that can derail even seemingly straightforward bills."

The House markup process culminated with a hearing held by the [Financial Services Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsba00) on May 29th, 2025, where the bill was reported out.  While specific vote details remain sparse - simply recorded as a referral - the initial movement indicates momentum behind the legislation's goals.\n\n**Politics:** Twenty-one members have cosponsored [HR3633](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/3633), including Representative Hill himself. Notably, Arkansas Rep. Hill is a member of the [Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/ssbk00), positioning him to play a key role in shaping the bill's trajectory within that influential panel.  Amendments have been proposed - specifically Amendment HAMDT 48 - which was adopted on July 17th, 2025 via agreement to the Rules amendment (A001). This amendment is derived from House Report 119-199 and Agriculture and [Financial Services Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsba00) materials.

The bill, reported out by the committee on July 10th and placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar under Calendar No. 113, signals a potential snag for its advancement this fall.\n\n**Inside the Room**\n\nThe bill's current status reveals a quiet operational phase. As of today, no hearings have been scheduled regarding [S2257](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/2257).  The legislative calendar entry simply notes \"Placed on Senate Legislative Calendar under General Orders.\" This action - recorded on July 10th - doesn't offer any insight into potential votes or the committee's disposition toward the legislation. Crucially, there has been no movement towards amendments. The \"amendments\" field associated with the bill remains blank, suggesting a lack of interest in altering its core provisions at this stage. Senator Mullin is listed as a sponsor, though he isn't currently serving on the [Appropriations Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/ssap00) itself - a factor that could influence momentum. \n\n**Politics**\n\nThe stalled progress of [S2257](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/2257) underscores the often-opaque nature of appropriations processes. While Mullin's sponsorship indicates his commitment to the bill, its placement solely within the [Appropriations Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/ssap00) suggests limited support from other key Senate leadership. The absence of hearings and amendments points to a potential area of contention among committee members, although specific disagreements aren't yet publicly apparent. \n\n**What's Next**\n\nWithout further action - either scheduling hearings or proposing amendments - [S2257](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/2257) is unlikely to move significantly forward in the coming weeks. The bill's fate will largely depend on the priorities and negotiations within the [Appropriations Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/ssap00), as well as any broader strategic considerations among Republican senators.  The lack of information regarding votes also leaves the future uncertain. \n\n**Closing Graf**\n\nAs Congress gears up for a busy fall session, [S2257](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/s-bill/2257)'s continued inaction highlights the challenges faced by individual bills seeking to break through the often-rigid structures of congressional appropriations."
