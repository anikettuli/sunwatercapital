### Ways & Means Advances Social Security Identity Theft Bill - But Details Remain Murky

By Sarah Miller - October 31, 2025

The [Ways and Means Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hswm00) today advanced the "Improving Social Security's Service to Victims of Identity Theft Act," a measure aimed at bolstering the agency's response to fraud targeting beneficiaries. The bill, introduced by [Rep. Kustoff, David](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/K000392) (R-TN-8), is now positioned on the House Calendar as Calendar No. 312 - a significant step toward potential floor action but one shrouded in procedural ambiguity.

The bill's advancement underscores the growing concern surrounding identity theft impacting Social Security recipients, a vulnerability highlighted by recent reports.  Timing is crucial as lawmakers grapple with broader budget negotiations and seek to address rising costs within the [Social Security Administration](https://www.ssa.gov/). 

During the markup, the [Ways and Means Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hswm00) considered the legislation. Notably, no amendments were offered - a decision that suggests a lack of immediate partisan disagreement on the core provisions, though the absence of specific vote tallies raises questions about the procedural path forward.  The bill was reported out by the committee on September 15, 2025, and placed on the Union Calendar on October 31, 2025.

"[Rep. Kustoff, David](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/K000392) (R-TN-8)," a member of the [Ways and Means Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hswm00), sponsored the bill alongside [Rep. Kustoff, David](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/K000392) (R-TN-8).  The legislation's placement on the Union Calendar signals a willingness to move it towards potential floor consideration - though its ultimate fate hinges on broader legislative priorities and strategic maneuvering within both parties. 

Next, the bill will await action by the House Rules Committee before potentially moving to a vote on the House floor. The path forward remains unclear regarding whether this legislation will proceed as a party-line effort or if bipartisan support can be secured.
