# Kustoff Champions Social Security Identity Theft Bill

By Sarah Miller - October 31, 2025

**WASHINGTON --** Rep. David Kustoff (R-TN-8) is pushing forward legislation aimed at bolstering the Social Security Administration's response to instances of identity theft affecting beneficiaries, according to House records. The "Improving Social Security's Service to Victims of Identity Theft Act" was marked up by the [Ways and Means Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hswm00) on September 17th, marking a key step in its potential passage.

**Inside the Room**

The bill, originating in the House, has been formally placed on the Union Calendar (Calendar No. 312) as of today.  It's currently housed within the [Ways and Means Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hswm00) - where it was marked up - and represents one of Rep. Kustoff's current initiatives.  A single cosponsor, also sitting on the [Ways and Means Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hswm00), Rep. Kustoff himself, has attached his name to the measure.  Crucially, no amendments have been proposed at this time, indicated by an empty "amendments" field within available data.  Eight actions related to the bill have been recorded, though details regarding their partisan nature remain unclear. 

**Politics**

The timing of the markup - September 17th - suggests a deliberate push by the Tennessee Republican to advance the legislation through the committee process. While specifics on potential impact are limited given the lack of amendments and available data on action partisanship, the bill's placement on the Union Calendar signifies some level of support within the House leadership.  The [Ways and Means Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hswm00)'s marked-up version indicates a degree of consensus among its members regarding the need for improved protections against identity theft impacting Social Security recipients - a concern increasingly highlighted by watchdog groups and constituent outreach.

**What's Next**

Next steps are currently unknown, as no votes have been scheduled or reported. The bill's path through the House remains fluid, contingent on committee consideration and subsequent action on the floor.  Further updates will be provided as they become available.

The "Improving Social Security's Service to Victims of Identity Theft Act" represents a relatively quiet but potentially significant effort within the broader context of ongoing debates about Social Security reform and beneficiary protections - signaling a continued focus on safeguarding vulnerable populations from fraud and abuse.
