# Grain Standards Bill Inches Closer to Vote as Committee Markups Completed

By Sarah Miller - Washington, D.C. - November 4, 2025

**Inside the Room:** The United States Grain Standards Reauthorization Act of 2025 ([HR4550](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/4550)) is moving through Congress, with both House and Senate [Agriculture Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsag00)s completing key procedural steps - though a final vote remains elusive.  The bill, spearheaded by Rep. Glenn Thompson (R-PA), has seen significant action in recent weeks, raising questions about the potential for bipartisan support and the next legislative hurdles.

**Immediate Context:** [HR4550](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/4550) seeks to reauthorize existing grain standards programs. The House [Agriculture Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsag00) reported the measure on September 3rd, followed by a markup on July 21st, and subsequent reporting on July 22nd.  Meanwhile, the Senate [Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/ssaf00) also reported the bill on November 3rd, with a markup occurring just days later on November 4th.

**Politics:** The bill's sponsorship by Rep. Thompson, a fixture on the House [Agriculture Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsag00), is already a significant factor in its potential passage.  He currently has one cosponsor - himself - highlighting what could be a strategy of leveraging committee influence to drive the legislation forward.  Notably, data indicates no votes have yet occurred on the bill itself. The November 4th placement on the Senate Legislative Calendar under General Orders suggests it's awaiting further action.  The lack of information regarding whether those actions were party-line or bipartisan underscores a critical unknown - how much leverage Thompson and his allies will wield in securing support.

**What's Next:** With both committees having completed their markup and reporting stages, the bill now awaits consideration on the Senate floor. The timing of a potential vote remains uncertain, though its placement on the Legislative Calendar signals an intention to move it forward.  Analysts are closely watching for signs of bipartisan engagement as the bill approaches a crucial threshold - the possibility of a vote. 

**Closing Graf:** As [HR4550](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/4550) navigates the complex landscape of Congressional procedure, the coming weeks will determine whether this reauthorization effort can translate into legislative success or remain stalled in committee.
