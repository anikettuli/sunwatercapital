### Committee Advances Grain Standards Reauthorization Amid Senate Calendar Push

By Amelia Stone - November 6, 2025

The "United States Grain Standards Reauthorization Act of 2025" [HR4550](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/4550) moved closer to a potential vote today as it was placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar under General Orders - marking a significant step in its journey through Congress. The move, occurring November 4, 2025, signals an attempt by leadership to expedite action on the bill before the Thanksgiving recess.

The legislation, sponsored by [Rep. Thompson, Glenn](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/T000467) (R-PA-15), seeks to reauthorize U.S. grain standards. Currently, the bill is facing review within both the House Agriculture Committee [Agriculture Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsag00) and the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee [Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/ssaf00).  Crucially, no amendments were identified during this process.

Inside the Room - While the bill was placed on the calendar, there have been no reported hearings or markup sessions associated with [H.R. 4550](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/4550). This lack of detailed discussion raises questions about potential roadblocks ahead, particularly given the complex nature of grain standards and their impact on agricultural producers.

The Politics - [Rep. Thompson, Glenn](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/T000467) is listed as a cosponsor, further suggesting that support for the reauthorization extends beyond the initial sponsor. However, given the current political climate and ongoing negotiations surrounding broader farm bill legislation, the path forward remains uncertain.  The timing of this calendar placement suggests an effort to build momentum towards a floor vote, although the absence of committee debate raises concerns about potential partisan divisions.

What's Next - The bill now awaits consideration by the full Senate. While the exact timeline for a floor vote is not yet known, leadership will likely continue to push for action in the coming weeks.  "[Rep. Thompson, Glenn](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/T000467) (R-PA-15)" stated previously that securing reauthorization is "vital" for American farmers and agricultural businesses. The next steps will determine whether this piece of legislation can gain the bipartisan support needed to advance through Congress.
