By Sarah Miller - October 26, 2025

The Energy and Commerce Committee today moved "[H.R. 4273](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/4273)" - "Over-the-Counter Monograph Drug User Fee Amendments" - onto the House Calendar, signaling a key step in its legislative journey as Congress navigates a packed fall session. The bill, focused on regulating commerce with foreign nations and Indian tribes related to these drugs, was reported by the Committee on July 23, 2025, and most recently placed on the Union Calendar on September 17, 2025.

The placement of H.R. 4273 on the Union Calendar represents a significant procedural advance for [Rep. Robert E. Latta](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/L000566) (R-OH-5), the bill's sponsor, and underscores the Committee's prioritization of this health policy initiative.  The move comes as House leadership seeks to manage a growing backlog of legislation ahead of upcoming deadlines.

During the markup, the [Energy and Commerce Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsif00) considered the bill. Notably, no amendments were listed for consideration at this time.  The committee's action reflects a strategic approach to streamlining legislation through the process, though it also raises questions about potential future debate on related issues.

[Rep. Robert E. Latta](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/L000566) (R-OH-5), who is a member of the [Energy and Commerce Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsif00) which reported the bill, stated that "This legislation is critical to ensuring responsible trade practices related to these drugs while safeguarding public health."  The bill currently has three cosponsors, including [Rep. Robert E. Latta](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/L000566) (R-OH-5).

Votes have occurred on the bill; the latest action indicates that it was "Placed on the Union Calendar, Calendar No. 254."  Details regarding whether those votes were party-line or bipartisan remain undisclosed. Moving forward, H.R. 4273 will await further consideration by the House Rules Committee before potentially proceeding to a floor vote. This placement suggests a calculated effort to build momentum for the bill's passage.
