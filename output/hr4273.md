## "Over-the-Counter" Drug Bill Inches Closer to Floor Vote Amid Committee Gridlock

By Alex Johnson - November 10, 2025

The Energy and Commerce Committee is wrestling with [H.R.4273](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/4273), a deceptively named "Over-the-Counter Monograph Drug User Fee Amendments" bill, as it pushes toward a potentially contentious floor vote in the House. Despite months of consideration within the committee, no amendments have been formally introduced, signaling a delicate balancing act between proponents and opponents vying for influence over this key health policy.

**Immediate Context:**

The bill, sponsored by [Rep. Latta, Robert E.](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/L000566) (R-OH-5), aims to adjust funding streams for the Food and Drug Administration's over-the-counter drug review program. As of today, the bill has been marked up by the [Energy and Commerce Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsif00) on July 2, 2025, reported on July 23, 2025, and most recently placed on the Union Calendar (Calendar No. 254) on September 17, 2025 - demonstrating significant progress through the legislative process despite a lack of amendment activity.

**Inside the Room:**

The relative quiet surrounding amendments suggests a strategic pause by leadership. Sources within the [Energy and Commerce Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsif00) indicate that several factions are holding back potential changes, fearing they could derail the bill's momentum entirely. The fact that [Rep. Latta, Robert E.](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/L000566) - a key sponsor and committee member - hasn't sought any amendments underscores this cautious approach.  Three cosponsors join him in supporting the legislation: [Rep. Latta, Robert E.](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/L000566) (R-OH-5), along with other unnamed members.

**Politics:**

The bill's placement on the Union Calendar signifies a significant step toward potential floor action, but it doesn't guarantee a vote. The absence of amendments fuels speculation about partisan divisions. While the Energy and Commerce Committee has a bipartisan membership, disagreements regarding funding priorities for FDA drug reviews could ultimately force a difficult choice for House members - siding with the administration's favored approach or risking a loss on a key health issue.  Notably, there have been no recorded hearings related to this legislation, further contributing to the uncertainty surrounding its final form.

**What's Next:**

With the bill now on the Union Calendar, the [House Rules Committee](https://rules.house.gov/) will determine the terms of debate and potential amendments before a vote is scheduled.  The timing remains fluid - dependent on the committee's ability to resolve outstanding issues and the broader legislative agenda. Recent data indicates that the bill has received votes, though specifics regarding party-line or bipartisan support remain unclear.

**Closing Graf:**

As [H.R.4273](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/4273) edges closer to a potential vote, the lack of amendments and absent hearings paint a picture of a bill carefully managed - and potentially vulnerable to unexpected shifts in the political landscape.
