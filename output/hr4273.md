# Over-the-Counter Drug Bill Gains Traction in Energy Committee

By Sarah Miller - Washington, D.C. - October 26, 2025

**Inside the Room:** A deceptively quiet bill concerning user fees for over-the-counter monograph drugs is quietly building momentum within the House [Energy and Commerce Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsif00) as it moves closer to a potential vote. [HR4273](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/4273), dubbed the "Over-the-Counter Monograph Drug User Fee Amendments," has navigated key procedural hurdles, signaling a strategic push by its sponsor, Rep. Robert Latta (R-OH-5).

**Immediate Context:** The bill, referred to the [Energy and Commerce Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsif00) on July 2nd, 2025, underwent a markup hearing on July 23rd, 2025, and was subsequently reported out by the committee on September 17th, 2025. Currently designated Calendar No. 254, it's positioned for consideration on the Union Calendar - a key step towards potential floor action.

**Inside the Room:** Latta's effort enjoys limited support so far, with only three cosponsors attached to the legislation. Notably, Rep. Robert Latta himself sits on the [Energy and Commerce Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsif00) that steered the bill through its initial stages.  Crucially, no amendments have been proposed during the markup process, according to data available as of today. The committee's reporting action occurred on July 23rd, marking a significant procedural step.

**Politics:** While details regarding the vote within the [Energy and Commerce Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsif00) remain unclear - with only "Reported By" and "Markup By" actions documented - the bill's placement on the Union Calendar suggests an intent to move it forward. The absence of amendments also simplifies the path toward potential floor action, though further debate is almost certainly expected. 

**What's Next:**  The next critical step for [HR4273](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/4273) will be its placement and discussion on the Union Calendar. From there, the bill's fate rests entirely on the ability of leadership to secure sufficient support for a vote - a task that remains uncertain given the limited number of cosponsors. The Hill will continue to monitor developments closely.

**Closing Graf:**  With no amendments filed and a dedicated committee sponsor, [HR4273](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/hr-bill/4273) represents a relatively straightforward path through Congress - at least for now. However, the bill's future hinges on navigating the often-turbulent waters of floor debate and securing enough votes to pass.
